# CodingTutorials
Coding Tutorials written to help others at organization. 

I created some tutorials at previous orgranizations to share my experience in speeding up slow code.  I wrote up example tutorials to demonstrate the speed increase. 

Example 1: 
For loops in pandas. 
Demonstrated the speed difference in a df.iterrows vs list comprehension on  alarge data frame.
